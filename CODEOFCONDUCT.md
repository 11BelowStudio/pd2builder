# Code of Conduct

## Purpose and Scope 
This code of conduct applies to community members and PD2Builder team members in all PD2Builder communities online (including but not limited to the PD2Builder official discord server, the official Starbreeze/Payday discord servers, the r/paydaybuilds subreddit and/or others).

Our community is dedicated to creating a tool which is fundamentally based on the principles of sharing, collaboration, and facilitating communication between people about a common interest.
It is our primary goal to create and maintain an instrument which reduces the barriers of communication between people of different regions or speaking different languages. We want to foster an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, computing experience, or clothing; both for team members and users.

## Behavior Policy
We do not tolerate harassment of or from community members in any form.
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to the protected classes above, sexual images in public channels, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, sustained disruption of official channels or other spaces, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Harassment does not need to be recognized as unwanted or unwelcome by anyone other than the person being harassed.  

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes are not appropriate and will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Users asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We are committed to addressing any reports of inappropriate condduct promptly and taking appropriate action, which may include removal of individuals from community spaces. If you are being harassed or notice that someone else is being harassed in an official space or channel, or have any other concerns, please contact the Administrator team in the [official PD2Builder discord server](https://discord.gg/wMGDuHdZ) immediately.
